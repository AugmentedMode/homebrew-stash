  caveats <<~EOS
    Quick paste optionally requires Accessibility permission.
    When upgrading from an ad-hoc signed version (before 1.0.2), you may need
    to remove and re-add Stash in Privacy & Security > Accessibility.
    Quit Stash before upgrading. Clipboard history and preferences are preserved.
